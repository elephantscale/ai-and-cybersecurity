# AI Security advice

### From [Ian Sideris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-sideris-baba67117/)

##### Thanks Mark. Man, one really has to exhaust oneself to keep up. For me ...
1. First and foremost I experiment hands-on. Sooner or later I have to do that. Even better are successful implementations in prod.
2. White papers and academic papers are essential, arXiv and the like
3. Industry conferences
4. Colleagues. We have some tremendous expertise here
5. Courses, the hyperscalers offer some nice jump start resources
6. Industry reference architectures. Several vendors have done excellent work.

And it's still exhausting :-)
