# How to keep up?

## AI security is cool!

* AI and security is the freshest area
  * That is, how do I make my newest AI app secure?
* Security advice from an expert

## Security advice

* Thanks Mark. Man, one really has to exhaust oneself to keep up. For me ...
1. First and foremost I experiment hands-on. Sooner or later I have to do that. Even better are successful implementations in prod.
2. White papers and academic papers are essential, arXiv and the like
3. Industry conferences
4. Colleagues. We have some tremendous expertise here
5. Courses, the hyperscalers offer some nice jump start resources
6. Industry reference architectures. Several vendors have done excellent work.

And it's still exhausting :-)
